d1: learned godot
d2: learned godot and got assets and animations
d3: set up first room

ai interactions: asking claude how to use godot and having it set up animations for me (huge)

challenges: animations take a long time to set up; solution: get llms to do it for you right once, write a guide, then use it for the rest
