d1: learned godot
d2: learned godot and got assets and animations
d3: set up first room
d4: multiplayer things
d5: multiplayer things, more assets

ai interactions: asking claude how to use godot and having it set up animations for me (huge)

challenges: animations take a long time to set up; 
    solution: get llms to do it for you right once, write a guide, then have it understand the pattern and write a script to programmatically set up the spriteframes, then can quickly add all animations for all character assets
