## bugs

- enemies don't use all their ap, just attack once and then end turn
- fix room generation: 
    - terrain set seems to just be brown and green ones
    - enemy spawning is wrong

## todos

- ui improvements everywhere
- ability tooltips
- floating damage numbers

later:
- roguelite procedural generation of room+enemy layouts
- xp system
- skill system
- upgrade system
- gold system /equip system (unlikely)
