## bugs

- enemies don't use all their ap, just attack once and then end turn
- room generator can spawn islands, sometimes isolating enemies
- ability cooldowns not decreasing after turns

## todos

- improve ap/mp stat display appearance.
- ui improvements everywhere

later:
- xp system
- skill system
