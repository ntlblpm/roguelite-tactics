## bugs

- death isn't working correctly
- enemies don't use all their ap, just attack once and then end turn
- when selecting an ability without moving the mouse and using a hotkey, the tile is not highlighted until the mouse moves

## todos

- ui improvements everywhere, starting with hp bars in turn order display
    - turn order display should use live cameras of each combatant
- should add end turn and give up hotkeys
- add more enemies to test room

later:
- roguelite procedural generation of room+enemy layouts
- xp system
- skill system
- upgrade system
- gold system /equip system (unlikely)
