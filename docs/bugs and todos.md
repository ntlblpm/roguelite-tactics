## bugs

- enemies don't use all their ap, just attack once and then end turn
- room generator can spawn islands, sometimes isolating enemies
- room generator can spawn enemies on unpathable terrain (need to verify)
- ability cooldowns not decreasing after turns

## todos

- remove spirit from enemy list
- improve ap/mp stat display appearance.
- ui improvements everywhere
- floating damage numbers

later:
- xp system
- skill system
- upgrade system
- gold system /equip system (unlikely)
