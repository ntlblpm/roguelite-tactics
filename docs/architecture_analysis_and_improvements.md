# Architecture Analysis & Improvement Recommendations

## Current Architecture Overview

The Roguelite Tactics codebase is a **multiplayer isometric tactical RPG** built in **Godot 4.4** with peer-to-peer networking. The current architecture follows a **component-based pattern** with some significant areas for improvement.

### Current System Architecture

```
GameController (Central Coordinator)
├── GridManager (spatial management)
├── TurnManager (turn-based logic)
├── Character Management (spawning, networking)
├── UI Coordination (stat updates, turn order)
└── Input Handling (tile clicks, movement)
```

### Core Systems
- **NetworkManager**: P2P networking with host authority
- **ProgressionManager**: Persistent character advancement
- **BaseCharacter**: Monolithic character class (inheritance-heavy)
- **GridManager**: Isometric grid with pathfinding
- **TurnManager**: Initiative-based turn system
- **UI System**: Scene-based modular interface

## Critical Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement

### 1. Heavy Inheritance Over Composition ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Current Problem:**
The `BaseCharacter` class is a monolithic god class that handles everything:

```gdscript
class_name BaseCharacter
extends CharacterBody2D

# ALL of this in one class:
- Health/MP/AP management
- Grid movement & pathfinding  
- Animation system
- Networking synchronization
- Input handling
- Combat mechanics
- Resource management
```

**Impact:**
- Difficult to test individual systems
- Code reuse limited by inheritance chains
- Adding new character types requires modifying base class
- Mixing of concerns makes debugging complex

**Recommended Solution:**
Implement composition-based architecture with focused components.

### 2. God Classes & Single Responsibility Violations

**GameController Issues:**
- Character spawning
- System coordination  
- UI management
- Input handling
- Turn management coordination
- Network state management

**BaseCharacter Issues:**
- Combat stats management
- Movement logic
- Animation control
- Network synchronization
- Turn-based logic

**Impact:**
- High complexity and maintenance burden
- Difficult to unit test
- Changes ripple across unrelated functionality

### 3. Tight Coupling Between Systems

**Current Problems:**
```gdscript
# Characters directly reference GridManager
var grid_manager: Node = null

# GameController directly manipulates UI elements
if hp_text:
    hp_text.text = "%d/%d" % [current_health, max_health]

# Turn manager directly controls UI
turn_manager.initialize_multiplayer(character_list, ui_button, chat_panel)
```

**Impact:**
- Systems cannot be developed/tested independently
- Changes in one system break others
- Difficult to swap implementations

### 4. Mixed Concerns & Layering Violations

**UI Logic in Game Systems:**
```gdscript
# In TurnManager - UI concerns mixed with game logic
if chat_panel:
    chat_panel.add_combat_message("Turn started")
```

**Network Code in Game Logic:**
```gdscript
# In BaseCharacter - networking mixed with movement
@rpc("any_peer", "call_local", "reliable")
func _execute_networked_movement(path: Array[Vector2i], cost: int)
```

**Impact:**
- Business logic tied to presentation layer
- Network concerns scattered throughout codebase
- Difficult to change networking or UI independently

### 5. No Clear State Management Pattern

**Current Problems:**
- Game state scattered across multiple classes
- No single source of truth
- Difficult to serialize/restore game state
- Race conditions in multiplayer scenarios

### 6. Hardcoded Dependencies

**Examples:**
```gdscript
# Hardcoded scene paths
@export var swordsman_scene: PackedScene = preload("res://players/swordsman/Swordsman.tscn")

# Hardcoded UI node paths  
@onready var hp_text: Label = $"path/to/specific/node"

# Magic numbers throughout
const BASIC_ENEMY_EXPERIENCE: int = 25
```

### 7. Testing Challenges

**Current Issues:**
- Impossible to unit test individual systems
- Dependencies on scene tree and UI nodes
- Network code mixed with game logic
- No mocking/stubbing capabilities

## Proposed Component-Based Architecture

### Core Component Design

Replace the monolithic `BaseCharacter` with focused, reusable components:

```gdscript
# Health Management Component
class_name HealthComponent
extends Node

signal health_changed(current: int, max: int)
signal died()
signal healed(amount: int)

var current_health: int
var max_health: int

func take_damage(amount: int) -> void
func heal(amount: int) -> void
func is_alive() -> bool
func get_health_percentage() -> float
```

```gdscript
# Action Points Component
class_name ActionPointsComponent
extends Node

signal points_changed(current: int, max: int)
signal points_consumed(amount: int)

var current_points: int
var max_points: int

func can_afford(cost: int) -> bool
func consume(cost: int) -> bool
func refresh() -> void
func get_remaining() -> int
```

```gdscript
# Movement Component
class_name MovementComponent
extends Node

signal movement_requested(target: Vector2i)
signal moved(from: Vector2i, to: Vector2i)
signal movement_failed(reason: String)

var current_position: Vector2i
var movement_points: int
var max_movement_points: int

func can_move_to(position: Vector2i) -> bool
func move_to(position: Vector2i) -> bool
func get_valid_moves() -> Array[Vector2i]
func refresh_movement_points() -> void
```

```gdscript
# Network Synchronization Component
class_name NetworkSyncComponent
extends Node

signal state_synchronized()
signal desync_detected()

func sync_component_state(component: Node, properties: Array[String]) -> void
func broadcast_change(property: String, value: Variant) -> void
func request_state_sync() -> void
```

```gdscript
# AI Behavior Component  
class_name AIComponent
extends Node

signal turn_started()
signal action_decided(action: AIAction)
signal turn_completed()

var ai_strategy: AIStrategy
var target_selector: TargetSelector

func process_turn() -> void
func set_strategy(strategy: AIStrategy) -> void
func evaluate_targets() -> Array[Node]
```

### Character Assembly Pattern

```gdscript
class_name Character
extends Node2D

# Core components
@onready var health: HealthComponent
@onready var action_points: ActionPointsComponent  
@onready var movement: MovementComponent
@onready var animation: AnimationComponent

# Optional components based on character type
var network_sync: NetworkSyncComponent
var ai_component: AIComponent
var abilities: AbilityComponent

func _ready() -> void:
    _setup_core_components()
    _setup_optional_components()
    _connect_component_signals()

func _setup_core_components() -> void:
    health = HealthComponent.new()
    action_points = ActionPointsComponent.new()
    movement = MovementComponent.new()
    animation = AnimationComponent.new()
    
    add_child(health)
    add_child(action_points)
    add_child(movement)
    add_child(animation)

func _setup_optional_components() -> void:
    if is_networked:
        network_sync = NetworkSyncComponent.new()
        add_child(network_sync)
    
    if is_ai_controlled:
        ai_component = AIComponent.new()
        add_child(ai_component)

func _connect_component_signals() -> void:
    health.died.connect(_on_character_died)
    movement.moved.connect(_on_character_moved)
    action_points.points_consumed.connect(_on_action_points_used)
```

### Event-Driven System Communication

Replace direct coupling with event-driven architecture:

```gdscript
# Central Event Bus (Autoload)
extends Node

# Character Events
signal character_spawned(character: Character)
signal character_died(character: Character)
signal character_moved(character: Character, from: Vector2i, to: Vector2i)
signal character_selected(character: Character)

# Combat Events
signal turn_started(character: Character)
signal turn_ended(character: Character)
signal damage_dealt(source: Character, target: Character, amount: int)
signal ability_used(character: Character, ability: Ability, targets: Array)

# UI Events
signal ui_update_requested(component: String, data: Dictionary)
signal notification_requested(message: String, type: String)

# Game State Events
signal game_state_changed(new_state: GameState)
signal save_requested()
```

Systems listen to relevant events instead of being directly coupled:

```gdscript
# UI System listens to game events
func _ready() -> void:
    EventBus.character_moved.connect(_on_character_moved)
    EventBus.turn_started.connect(_on_turn_started)
    EventBus.damage_dealt.connect(_on_damage_dealt)

# Turn Manager listens to character events
func _ready() -> void:
    EventBus.character_died.connect(_remove_from_turn_order)
    EventBus.turn_ended.connect(_advance_to_next_turn)
```

## System-Specific Improvements

### 1. State Management Refactor

```gdscript
# Centralized Game State
class_name GameState
extends RefCounted

var characters: Dictionary # id -> CharacterState
var current_turn: TurnState
var combat_phase: CombatPhase
var grid_state: GridState
var network_state: NetworkState

# State mutations through actions only
func apply_action(action: GameAction) -> GameState
func serialize() -> Dictionary
func deserialize(data: Dictionary) -> GameState
```

```gdscript
# Action Pattern for State Changes
class_name GameAction
extends RefCounted

func execute(state: GameState) -> GameState
func undo(state: GameState) -> GameState
func validate(state: GameState) -> bool
```

### 2. Dependency Injection Pattern

```gdscript
# Service Locator for Dependency Management
class_name ServiceLocator
extends Node

var services: Dictionary = {}

func register_service(name: String, service: Node) -> void
func get_service(name: String) -> Node
func unregister_service(name: String) -> void

# Usage
func _ready() -> void:
    ServiceLocator.register_service("GridManager", grid_manager)
    ServiceLocator.register_service("TurnManager", turn_manager)
```

### 3. Configuration-Driven Design

```gdscript
# Character Configuration
# res://data/characters/swordsman.json
{
    "name": "Swordsman",
    "base_stats": {
        "health": 100,
        "action_points": 6,
        "movement_points": 3,
        "initiative": 15
    },
    "components": [
        "HealthComponent",
        "ActionPointsComponent", 
        "MovementComponent",
        "MeleeAttackComponent"
    ],
    "abilities": ["slash", "guard", "charge"],
    "sprite_paths": {
        "idle": "res://assets/entities/swordsman/idle.png",
        "run": "res://assets/entities/swordsman/run.png"
    }
}
```

```gdscript
# Configuration Loader
class_name CharacterFactory
extends RefCounted

static func create_character(config_path: String) -> Character:
    var config = load_config(config_path)
    var character = Character.new()
    
    # Setup components based on configuration
    for component_name in config.components:
        var component = create_component(component_name)
        character.add_child(component)
    
    return character
```

### 4. Improved Error Handling

```gdscript
# Result Type Pattern
class_name Result
extends RefCounted

var success: bool
var data: Variant
var error: String

static func ok(value: Variant) -> Result:
    var result = Result.new()
    result.success = true
    result.data = value
    return result

static func error(message: String) -> Result:
    var result = Result.new()
    result.success = false
    result.error = message
    return result

# Usage
func move_character(character: Character, position: Vector2i) -> Result:
    if not is_valid_position(position):
        return Result.error("Invalid position")
    
    if not character.can_move_to(position):
        return Result.error("Character cannot reach position")
    
    character.move_to(position)
    return Result.ok(position)
```

### 5. Testing Architecture

```gdscript
# Mock Components for Testing
class_name MockHealthComponent
extends HealthComponent

var mock_health: int = 100
var damage_taken: Array[int] = []

func take_damage(amount: int) -> void:
    damage_taken.append(amount)
    mock_health -= amount
    health_changed.emit(mock_health, max_health)
```

```gdscript
# Unit Test Example
class_name TestCharacterCombat
extends GutTest

func test_character_takes_damage():
    var character = Character.new()
    var mock_health = MockHealthComponent.new()
    character.add_child(mock_health)
    
    character.health.take_damage(25)
    
    assert_eq(mock_health.damage_taken[0], 25)
    assert_eq(mock_health.mock_health, 75)
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Component Foundation
1. **Create core components**: HealthComponent, ActionPointsComponent, MovementComponent
2. **Implement EventBus**: Central event system
3. **Refactor one character type**: Convert Swordsman to composition pattern
4. **Basic testing setup**: Unit tests for components

### Phase 2: System Decoupling
1. **Extract UI logic**: Separate UI updates from game logic
2. **Implement Service Locator**: Remove direct system dependencies  
3. **State management**: Centralized GameState with action pattern
4. **Configuration system**: JSON-driven character/ability setup

### Phase 3: Network & AI Refactor
1. **NetworkSyncComponent**: Extract networking from character logic
2. **AI Component system**: Pluggable AI strategies
3. **Error handling**: Result types and graceful degradation
4. **Performance optimization**: Object pooling, batched updates

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (1-2 weeks)
1. **Comprehensive tests**: Unit and integration test suite
2. **API documentation**: Component interfaces and contracts
3. **Migration guide**: How to add new characters/abilities
4. **Performance benchmarks**: Measure improvements

## Benefits of Proposed Architecture

### Development Benefits
- **Modularity**: Easy to add new character types and abilities
- **Testability**: Unit test components in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Changes localized to specific components
- **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different components

### Runtime Benefits  
- **Performance**: Lighter objects, better memory usage
- **Flexibility**: Mix and match capabilities per entity
- **Debugging**: Easier to isolate and fix issues
- **Extensibility**: Plugin-style architecture for new features

### Long-term Benefits
- **Code Reuse**: Components shared across different entity types
- **Feature Development**: Faster iteration on new gameplay mechanics
- **Platform Porting**: Easier to adapt for different platforms
- **Community**: Modding support through component system

## Conclusion

The current inheritance-heavy architecture has served well for initial development, but transitioning to composition-based design will significantly improve code quality, maintainability, and extensibility. The proposed component system addresses the major weaknesses while preserving the existing functionality and multiplayer capabilities.

**Immediate Priority**: Start with Phase 1 to establish the component foundation and prove the architecture with one character type before proceeding with full system refactor.
